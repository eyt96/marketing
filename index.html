											<h1>What is CROW Marketplace?</h1>
										</header>
										<p> 
										Purchase items on CROW Marketplace, the go-to Ethereum Blockchain Marketplace, where we specialise in escrow services.
										Transactions are secure and refunds are guranteed for missing items.
										</br></br>	
										See an item you like? Buy it with your MetaMask Crypto e-wallet and verify upon receiving your item! 
										</br></br>
										Wish it were cheaper? Fret not! - CROW Marketplace allows you to negotiate with the product's seller so both parties are satisfied!
										</br></br>
										Every purchase made on our platform will generate a unique smart contract between the seller and buyer, so transactional issues can be easily mitigated.
										</p>

										<header class="major">
										<h1>CROW Payment Option</h1>
										</header>
										<p>
										In our marketplace there is only one currency that we are invested in, and that is Etheruem! Simply pay through the meta-mask extension
										with Ethereum currency and it will securely go through our Blockchain! 
										How the payment works is that the agreement between the buyer and seller is kept
										by a third party which is our blockchain until the specific CONDITIONS are met in the smart contract agreement.
										After the order is verified to be received, the payment will go through to the seller and 
										the collaterals that both the buyer and seller have given will be returned!
										</p>
										
										<header class="major">
										<h1>What are Collaterals?</h1>
										</header>
										<p>
										What makes CROW marketplace unique is where we ensure that both ends of the agreement are always met! Collaterals are calculated based on the item price 
										that is listed on the CROW marketplace. 
										Every time a smart contract agreement is made between the buyer and seller, a collateral is required to be paid 
										by both. 
										This collateral encourages both ends to do their parts to complete the smart contract agreement.

										<h3>Blockchain</h3>
										<p>Blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions that records information in a way that makes it nearly impossible to hack or cheat the system, 
											making it a verifiable and auditable record of every transaction. </p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/blockchain network.JPG" alt=""></span>
										<h3>Network</h3>
										<p>The blockchain network is where to digital ledger of transactions is distributed over the entire network. 
											The Distributed Ledger Technology is a decentralised database which is managed by multiple participants. 
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/proof of work blockchain.JPG" alt=""></span>
										<h3>Proof of Work</h3>
										<p>All or any validated records are not able to be changed and are irrevisible. All network participants have a copy of the ledger
											for complete transperency. So all information that goes through the blockchain are secure and all the records are individually encrypted.
										</p>
									</li>
