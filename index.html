										<h2>Unique Selling Point</h2>
										</header>
										<p class="content2">
											CROW specialises in escrow services and acts as a third party for all smart contracts on our platform. 
											What this means is that CROW will hold collateral from the buyer and seller of a smart contract. 
											These collaterals will only released back to both parties upon successful verification of items received on CROW by the buyer, 
											only then will CROW release the sale proceeds to the seller from the item he had sold. This ensure both parties
											keep to their end of the agreement.
											</br></br>	
											A simple illustration of how CROW handles collaterals:

											</br></br>											
											The collateral reduces the risk factor for both parties as buyers are expected to meet 
											their financial obligation which minimizes risk for sellers.   
											
											</br></br>
											Collaterals are a fixed rate from the price of an item that is listed on the CROW marketplace.

										<h2>Payment</h2>
										</header>
										<p class="content2">
										Our marketplace requires users to transact in Ether, which is the cryptocurrency built on top of the open source Ethereum blockchain.
										</br></br>
										Payment of goods are made using MetaMask, a web browser extension that functions as a crypto wallet and gateway to blockchain applications.

										<h3>Blockchain</h3>
										<p class="content2">
											Blockchain is a public digital ledger of transactions that is developed based on a 
											peer-to-peer system that creates an unchangeable record of transactions, 
											each time-stamped and linked to the previous one.
											It is nearly impossible to modify the system going unnoticed,  
											making it effective to verify and audit record of every transaction. 
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/blockchain network.JPG" alt=""></span>
										<h3>Network</h3>
										<p class="content2">
											Users of the blockchain network have access to the distributed ledger and the immutable record of transactions.
											Since blockchain is a shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once. This prevents the 
											possibility of duplicated effort that frequently occurs within traditional business networks.
										</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="image"><img src="images/proof of work blockchain.JPG" alt=""></span>
										<h3>Proof of Work</h3>
										<p class="content2">
											Proof of work makes it extremely difficult to alter any aspect of the blockchain 
											as any changes would require re-mining all subsequent blocks of a blockchain. 
											Proof of work also makes it challenging for a user or pool of users to monopolize the 
											network's computing power. This is because the machinery and power necessary to perform 
											the hash functions are expensive.

								"Safe Remote Purchase Logic, Escrow Service as a Smart Contract: The Business Logic"

								illustration above</i></span>
								</br></br>
								<span id="qn">What is the significance of initiating the smart contract?</span>
								</br>
								The seller will need to stake 2x the value of what he is selling.
								</br></br>
								
								
								<span id="qn">What is the significance of confirming a purchase?</span>
								</br>
								The purchaser will need to stake 2x the value of what he is buying.
								</br></br>
								
								<span id="qn">What is the significance of confirming delivery?</span>
								</br>
								This triggers the Smart Contract to return 1ETH to John and 3ETH to Peter. Confirming delivery concludes the transaction.
								</br></br>
								
								<span id="qn">Isn’t Peter selling? Why must he stake ETH worth 2x of the value of his widget to the Smart Contract?</span>
								</br>
								By staking 2x of the value of his widget to the Smart Contract, Peter is committed to delivering his widget to John. Or else he loses double the value of his widget.
								</br></br>
								
								<span id="qn">Why can’t Peter just stake 1ETH then, which is what his widget is worth?</span>
								</br>
								If Peter stakes only 1ETH, his stake is less than John’s, which is 2ETH. If he doesn’t deliver his widget to John, he loses only 1ETH while John loses 2ETH.
								</br></br>

								<span id="qn"> Why must John stake 2x the value of the widget he is purchasing? </span>
								</br>
								Imagine if John stakes only 1ETH, Peter delivers, and John refuses to confirm the delivery. Peter will lose 2ETH and John loses nothing!
								</br></br>
								
								<span id="qn"> Then why not let both John and Peter stake only 1ETH each? </span>
								</br>
								If John receives the goods and does not confirm it, he loses nothing, while Peter loses not only 1ETH, but his widget as well. The significance of making both seller and buyer stake ETH worth 2x the value of the widget is that this motivates both parties to carry the full process of the transaction, from initiation to delivery confirmation. This illustrates the beauty of a well designed smart contract which in this case, ensures fairness for both the buyer and seller.
								</br></br>
								
								<span id="qn">Can the Smart Contract lie and not return ETHs to John and/or Peter? </span>
								</br>
								The codes for a Smart Contract can be verified and displayed for all to see on Etherscan.io.
								</br></br>
								
								<span id="qn">What if the widget cost 1.43546ETH, I mean, what if it does not yield a whole number when divided by 2? </span>
								</br>
								Unfortunately that would mean you lose some ETH due to rounding.
